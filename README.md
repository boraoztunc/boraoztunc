# hello world. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a multidisciplinary designer who conceives creative concepts, creates branding projects from the ground up and translates them into compelling visual experiences by developing ideas, providing quality art and creative direction. I build for brands that inform, entertain and inspire with 14+ years of experience.
