# hello world. ðŸ‘‹

I'm an entrepreneur by passion and generalist by nature. I develop creative concepts, make projects from the ground up and translate them into compelling visual experiences by generating ideas, quality art and creative direction. I build brands that inform, entertain and inspire with 15+ years of experience.


### Projects

âœ¤ <a class="goto-social" href="https://1984.design" target="_blank">1984.design</a> is a knowledge platform helping designers feel inspired and make better design decisions. Design and humane technology have a unique role in solving some of the most complex challenges the world is facing, and I believe if it is design that got us here, design can get us out.
						   
						
âœ¤ <a class="goto-social" href="https://moe.travel" target="_blank">Moe</a> is a global marketplace that offers eco-friendly outdoor stays and experiences. Adventure means something different to each of us, but rather than these differences dividing us, we are united by our love for our planet and the outdoors. As a startup I co-founded, we provide our guests more meaningful, sustainable ways to explore the world and our hosts how to apply sustainability criteria to their businesses.
